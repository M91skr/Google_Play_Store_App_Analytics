# Google_Play_Store_App_Analytics

## Collecting Android software data in beautiful graphs (with Plotly)

## Description

In this code,  i will compare thousands of apps in the Google Play Store.
about Data:
    • the data is just a sample out of all the Android apps.
    • during the web scraping process, this sample was served up based on geographical location and user behaviour of the person who scraped it - in our case Lavanya Gupta.
    • The data was compiled around 2017/2018. The pricing data reflect the price in USD Dollars at the time of scraping.
    • converted the app’s size to a floating-point number in MBs. If data was missing, it has been replaced by the average size for that category.
    • The installs are not the exact number of installs and removed the '+' 

I practiced in this code:
    • How to quickly remove duplicates
    • How to remove unwanted symbols and convert data to numeric format
    • How to interpolate columns containing nested data with pandas
    • How to create compelling data visualizations with the plotly library
    • Create vertical, horizontal and grouped bar charts
    • Create pie and donut charts for categorical data
    • Use color scales to create beautiful scatter plots
